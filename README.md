# SPARQLmashup

A preliminary tutorial on how to make a digital music mashup using the Semantic Web technology stack.

# What is a mashup

# The framework
A framework was contructed as result of research on the subject of the possibilities of making digital music mashups concretely by means of SPARQL queries on MIDI Linked Data (see https://midi-ld.github.io)

See FRAMEWORK.png for a very preliminary version of the framework

# Query for the mashup
The following query was constructed to be used on the MIDI Linked Data SPARQL endpoint (see http://virtuoso-midi.amp.ops.labs.vu.nl/sparql) in order to generate a MIDI Linked Data mashup:

# More queries

Before the final query can be made, the MIDI Linked Data cloud needs to be explored in order to find
- two songs with the same tempo
- tracks from those songs that are going to be used in the mashup

See queries.pdf for all queries that are required for making a mashup
