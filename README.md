# SPARQLmashup
A framework on how to make a digital music mashup using the Semantic Web technology stack.

<i>all required queries (Q1-Q6) can be found in queries.pdf</i>


## What is a mashup
A mashup is a song or composition created by blending two or more pre-recorded songs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashup_(music)).

A few key skills need to be mastered in order to make a mashup. These skills are called beatmatching and mixing in key (harmonic mixing). Beatmatching is a technique which involves the process matching the beats per minute (BPM) of different tracks in order to synchronize the tracks with each other. This is done by adjusting the tempo of some track to match the other trackâ€™s tempo. Harmonic mixing on the other hand is the process of getting two tracks in the same key, or in relative keys, so there are no dissonant tones between the tracks when they are mixed (http://spin-academy.com/how-to-make-a-mashup/).

## The framework
The framework was contructed as result of research on the subject of the possibilities of making digital music mashups concretely by means of SPARQL queries on MIDI Linked Data (see https://midi-ld.github.io)

### Query for the mashup
A query is constructed to be used on the MIDI Linked Data SPARQL endpoint (see http://virtuoso-midi.amp.ops.labs.vu.nl/sparql) in order to generate a MIDI Linked Data mashup. 

```SPARQL
PREFIX prov: <http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#> 
PREFIX mid: <http://purl.org/midi-ld/midi#>

CONSTRUCT { <newsong> a mid:Pattern ;
mid:hasTrack ?track . 
<newsong> mid:format ?format .
<newsong> mid:resolution ?resolution .
?track mid:hasEvent ?event .
?track a mid:Track .
?event a ?type .
?event ?property ?value .
}

WHERE { 
{
<pattern1> mid:hasTrack ?track .
<pattern1> mid:format ?format .
<pattern1> mid:resolution ?resolution .
?track mid:hasEvent ?event .
?event a ?type .
?event ?property ?value .
FILTER (?track IN (<track1>, <track2>, <and so on>, <arbitrary>))
} UNION {
<pattern2> mid:hasTrack ?track .
<pattern2> mid:format ?format .
<pattern2> mid:resolution ?resolution .
?track mid:hasEvent ?event .
?event a ?type .
?event ?property ?value .
FILTER (?track IN (<track1>, <track2>, <and so on>, <arbitrary>))
}
}
```

### More queries
Before the final query can be used, the MIDI Linked Data cloud needs to be explored in order to find
- two songs with the same tempo
- tracks from those songs that are going to be used in the mashup

Values have to be found for:
```SPARQL
the first song: <pattern1> and its' tracks: <track1>, <track2> <and so on>
the second song: <pattern2> and its' tracks: <track1>, <track2> <and so on>
```

<i>See queries.pdf for all queries that are required for making a mashup</i>
